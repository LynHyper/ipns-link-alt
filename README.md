# IPNS-Link Spec Alternative

## Intro

Check out the official specs repo at https://github.com/ipns-link/specs.

IPNS-Link is a decentralised Ngrok alternative developed by the IPNS-Link team (of which I am a part of), this repo exists so I can experiment with ideas for IPNS-Link without creating unnecessary issues or discussions in the official specs repo, ideas in this repo may be adopted by IPNS-Link officially if the idea is deemed suitable and worthwhile to accept.

## Goals

- Decentralisation to the highest degree reasonably possible.
- High CPU and bandwidth efficiency, both for Exposer and Gateways, without compromising security or UX friendliness.
- Simplification and refinement; attempt to replicate IPNS-Link's current features with less complexity.

For documentation of ideas, head to the [Wiki](https://github.com/LynHyper/ipns-link-alt/wiki).
