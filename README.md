# IPNS-Link Spec Alternative

## Intro

IPNS-Link is a decentralised Ngrok alternative developed over at https://github.com/ipns-link, I created this repo so I could experiment with new ideas for IPNS-Link without adding unnecessary issues or discussions to the official spec repo, this repo doen **not** outline an alternative to IPNS-Link; this repo outlines alternatives methods that IPNS-Link itself could be adapted to use in the future.

## Goals

- Decentralisation to the highest degree reasonably possible.
- high CPU and bandwidth efficiency, both for Exposer and Gateways, where possible without compromising security or UX friendliness.
- Simplification and refinement; attempt to replicate IPNS-Link's current features with less complexity.

For documentation of ideas, head to the [Wiki](https://github.com/LynHyper/ipns-link-alt/wiki).
